This is Nvim spaceduck theme port written in Lua.

# Inspiration ðŸ’­

This theme was inspired from my incessant desire to feel like I'm in space when I stare at a computer.
"Spaceduck" takes its name from my love of [duck dodgers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY2YjgyZGMtMWY2Zi00ZmQ5LTg0YjgtNjYyMGNkMTMzNWU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4NjcxOTc@._V1_.jpg) as a kid.

# Current Language Support

Basically languages I looked at with my eyes to make sure they didn't look like poop.

**Languages:**

_Note: if something looks off please submit an issue with a screenshot_

- C, C++, fortran, haskell, html, java, javascript, markdown, php, python, ruby, sql, LaTeX, typescript

# Installation

## [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use({ "spaceduck-theme/nvim", as = "spaceduck" })
```

We use semver on spaceduck so you can refer to a specific tag if you want instead of the `master` branch.
