	<strong>Spaceduck for neovim. All Lua, all spaceduck, always intergalactic.</strong>

<hr>

This is Nvim spaceduck theme port written in Lua.

# Installation

## [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use({ "spaceduck-theme/nvim", as = "spaceduck" })
```

We use semver on spaceduck so you can refer to a specific tag if you want instead of the `master` branch.

We use [`gitmoji`](https://gitmoji.dev/) and [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to respectively give meaning to our commits and automatically version the project based on these commits. `gitmoji` has a lot of different emojis you can use to give meaning to your commits. We recommend you check the link given to familiarize yourself with it. They provide a [quizz website](https://gitmemoji.lalilo.com/) to learn it.
